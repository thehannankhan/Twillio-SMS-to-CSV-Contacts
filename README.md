Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from Node.js website.

Step 2: Install Required Packages
Open your terminal and create a new directory for your project, then navigate into it:

sh
``mkdir twilio-sms
cd twilio-sms``


Initialize a new Node.js project:

sh
``npm init -y``


Install the required packages:

sh
``npm install twilio csv-parser``


CSV File Format
Your CSV file (contacts.csv) should have the following format:
``phoneNumber,message
+1234567890,Hello, this is a test message!
+0987654321,Hi there! Just checking in.``


Running the Script
Make sure your send-sms.js and contacts.csv are in the same directory. Open your terminal in this directory and run the script:
``node send-sms.js``


Note: Be mindful of the rate limits. Might need to set up a spend cap
